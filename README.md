# C-XML-Parser
This short program accepts a list of floating point scores >= 0 from the user and  calculates the number of entries, the minimum entry, the maximum entry, the average of  the entries, and finally the standard deviation of the scores.  These values are displayed to  the user in this order, separated by tabs.
